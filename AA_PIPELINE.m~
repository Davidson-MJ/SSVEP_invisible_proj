%PIPELINE

%this script steps through the analysis for our PFI + frequency-tagging
%project, with individually calibrated targets.

% Behavioural scripts are numbered in order, and have the prefix BEH, 
% EEG scripts follow.

                        %% BEHAVIOURAL ANALYSIS:
%job1: load the behavioural data, and epoch around all catch events (named
%PMD in paper). This script also performs the calculation of shuffled
%button-press likelihood around PMD onset. Determines which trials should
%be removed from further analysis (failed PMD). 

%contains script to plot Supp Figure  2 (PMD button press).
job.epochBEH_CATCH                      =0;  
%%
%job2: epoch around all PFI. This scripts sorts based on the number of
%buttons pressed, and direction. e.g. 2->3 buttons pressed, 3->2 buttons
%pressed, etc. Also performs shuffling analysis, to compare rates of
%simultaneous PFI to that expected by chance.

%contains script to plot Supp Figure  5 (PFI location shuffling analysis).
job.epochBEH_PFI                        =0;
                                %%  EEG
%job3: EEG preprocessing. This can be batched. 
%imports from .bdf, auto bad chan reject, whole-trial epoch (48x60s),
job.BatchPREPROCESS_eeg                 = 0;

%%
%job4: Epoch PFI and PMD periods from EEG, based on results from job 1, 2 above.
job.epochPFI_PMDeeg                        = 0;

%job5: after all PFI and PMD epochs have been collected (EEG in
%time-domain), construct RESS spatial filters per participant, and relevant
%frequency.
job.createRESSfilt_perppant                =0;
 
%job6: having created new individual participant RESS filters, apply to
%both the PFI and PMD data, before continuing analysis on RESS components.
job.applyRESSto_chandata                   =0;
 
%job7: take moving window spectrogram of EEG data during PFI. 
%sorts all PFI by amount of buttons pressed (in descending order). Prints
%results per participant, as well as concatenates across participants, to
%compare by 'amount of PFI', after resampling along trial dimension.
%same for PMD.
job.sortPFI_PMD_EEG                          =0;

%job8 calculate evoked alpha per participant, 
% perform cluster based corrections (in fieldtrip), and save output
job.alphajobs                               =0;


%% % Final plotting:

%plots wholetrial log(spectrum), SNR, and topoplots.
% shown in Supp figure 3.
job.plot_wholetrial_preRESS

% plots the RESS log(snr) over time for separate hz, and PFI/PMD
